Equals Method:


Q1. When is comparable method called ?
Ans. When sorting, TreeMap or a collection that is sorted

How to Override Equals ?
- Why is typecasting used in equals method to method class ?, for "this"
- obj.value == this.value : 
obj doesn't have a data member value here.
Typecast is successful as it is a sub class of Object 

Subscripts:

1. int [] a,b -> two integer arrays
2. int a[], b[] -> two integer arrays
3. int a[],b -> one integer array and integer

4. int a[3] = {1,4,5}. SOP(a) -> error: the token 3 is error
cannot declare array size while initialization

Print 2d Array -> deepToString(array)


Arrays.sort() of sorts as per ASCII values so 111 comes before any other value 
circle [] obj = new circle[3];
gives null pointer exception as it creates just 3 references and not actual 3 objects



Programs:

Q1. Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order

Example:
Input: 5
-4 -1 0 3 10
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]


Q2. Given an array of integers arr, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

In one step, you can jump from index i to index:
-> i+1 where: i+1 < arr.length
-> i-1 where: i - 1 >=0
-> j where: arr[i] == arr[j] and i!=j

Return the minimum number of steps to reach end of the array

Example:
Input: [100,-23,-23,404,100,23,23,23,3,404]
Output: 3
