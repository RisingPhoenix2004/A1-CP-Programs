Constructor Chaining:
- 
For a final class, all its methods are final implicitly 
Final 4 types:
Methods
Classes
Variables
Function Parameters

For Class to be immutable:
- Final class
- No setters
- private variables

static:
- One copy with all objects
- Static gets initialized without any object, can be accessed without any object creation

- Every time a static variable is called from object, then object gets replaced with the Class. [ t1.val gets replaced to Test.val ]

Private Constructors:
Y main method is static ?
- JVM needs to access the main method, so the main method is accesssed using the class name
- Java Virtual Machine (JVM) without creating an instance of the class 


Create a singleton design pattern there are three steps to follow:
1. Declare a data member/ object that is static 
2. Define constructor as private
3. Define a static member function which end users can call which internally calls the constructor to create the object
