Java packages & Jar Files

component object model -> com

PIC -> Code Writing Schema Acronym
Package -> Import -> Class

To remove Package ambiguity, can use fully qualified package name, Like Pack1.test1 and Pack1.subpack1.test1 as example names when creating reference objects of the classes


If we do explicit import then that class (like java.test1), has precedence over an import of kind  wildcard "java.*"

Imports of same kind can override each other, the latest one is considered, which might lead to ambiguous import conditions;

All data types in Python are immutable like Wrapper classes in Java
Primitive Types in Java are Mutable ?
