OCA Chapter 2:

Arithmetic Operations on byte or short are autoboxed to integers, assigning back to short leads to error as Integer result is being assigned to short

Float is by default considered as  double so to declare float we have to keep 'f'

Does ++i and i++ matter in Loops ?

It matters only when i is used in the for loop computation

instanceOf returns true is given object is instance of the given type

variable instanceof Object_name/Object

C,C++ anything zero is false else is true Whereas in Java it should be only if(Boolean) and ntg else is allowed

|| / short circuit operator doesn't check the second part of the condition if First expression is True
