System Design / OCA Concepts

What is a Constructor ?

- Initializes a given class instance or object
- Constructor is Spl Function
- Same name as Class name so it is Spl
- Constructor needn't be explicitly defined or declared
Why we need constructor in java ?
- To create an object, we need constructor, else we loose meaning of OOP part of programming language

Why we need Getters and Setters ?
- Data Encapsulation & Data Protection. Allows Different Access levels for variables

Ask not what the System does. Ask what it does it to

Can Constructor be Private ?
- Yes, Default Constructor is always public in nature
- A function with return type is not a Constructor

Why cannot the constructor have a return type ?
- Return type of Constructor is the object of that class
- Error: If constructor has a return type: Constructor cannot be applied as void circle() and circle() are diff

Block:
- Conditional Block, Looping Block, Method Block
- Instance initialization and static initialization 0> for initializing the object
- Execute before object is created
- Before Constructor
- Instance Comes whenever an object is created
- static is when the class is loaded
- First static intialization, then Instance Initialization 
- Instance Block: { }

Print an Object like (System.out.println(new Random(10)))class name + hexadecimal rep of hash code





All Instance variables have a default value. Bool is False and other primitive data types are 0 or forms. Non-Primitive Data Types are null by default


Follow OOP philosophy.
