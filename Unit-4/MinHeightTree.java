/*
 * A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by
 * exactly one path.
 * In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.
 * 
 * Given a tree of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1,
 * and an array of n - 1 edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates
 * that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes ai and bi in the tree,
 * 
 * You can choose any node of the tree as the root.
 * When you select a node x as the root, the result tree has height h.
 * Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. min(h))
 * are called minimum height trees (MHTs).
 * 
 * Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any
 * order.
 * 
 * The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward
 * path
 * between the root and a leaf.
 * 
 * Sample Input-1:
 * ---------------
 * 4 3 //no of vertices and no of edges
 * 1 0
 * 1 2
 * 1 3
 * 
 * Sample Output-1:
 * ----------------
 * [1]
 * 
 * Explanation:The height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label
 * 1
 * which is the only MHT.
 * 
 * Sample Input-2:
 * ---------------
 * 6 5 //no of vertices and no of edges
 * 3 0
 * 3 1
 * 3 2
 * 3 4
 * 5 4
 * 
 * Sample Output-2:
 * ----------------
 * [3, 4]
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * ------------
 * -> 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
 * -> edges.length == n - 1
 * -> 0 <= ai, bi < n
 * -> ai != bi
 * -> All the pairs (ai, bi) are distinct.
 * -> The given input is guaranteed to be a tree and there will be no repeated
 * edges.
