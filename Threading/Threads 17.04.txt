Write locks

Locking & Threads:
-------------------
### Locks
A lock is a synchronization primitive that allows only one thread to access a shared resource at a time.
### Locks in Java
Java provides the `synchronized` keyword to create locks. The `synchronized` keyword can be
applied to methods or blocks of code.
### Locking in Java
java
public class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 0;
    public void withdraw(int amount) {
        synchronized (this) {
            if (balance >= amount) {
                balance -= amount;


synchronization and locks:
1. Only one thread can acquire a lock
2. Methods can only be synchronized
3. If a threads acquires a lock on an object -> then no other thread can access any other method that is synchronized
4. 


If both exists, then multiple threads can call unsync



notify, notifyall, wait ->  final methods in the Object class
