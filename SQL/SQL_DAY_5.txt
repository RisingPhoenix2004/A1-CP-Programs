Transaction Control Language (TCL):
TCL is a scripting language that is used to automate tasks and workflows. It is widely used in
networking and system administration. TCL is known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it a popular choic
e for automating tasks and workflows.
What is a transaction ?
A transaction is a sequence of operations performed on a database that are executed as a single, all-or
nothing unit of work. Transactions are used to ensure data consistency and integrity in a database.

Transaction's important property atomciity
The atomicity property of a transaction ensures that either all or none of the operations in the transaction are
executed. If any operation in the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back and the database is
restored to its previous state.

Commands:
1. Commit:
The commit command is used to save the changes made by a transaction. When a commit is issued,
the changes are written to the database and the transaction is completed.
2. Rollback:
The rollback command is used to undo the changes made by a transaction. When a rollback is issued,
the changes are discarded and the database is restored to its previous state.
3. Save point:
A save point is a point in a transaction where the changes made by the transaction can be saved.
The save point can be used to roll back the transaction to the save point if any operation in the transaction fails.

After commit, all savepoints are deleted.

Stored Procedure:
- SQL statements
- Stored Server side
- Equivalent to Java API

Advantages of Stored Procedures:
- Reusability
- Reduces network traffic
- Reduces compile time as the database uses a pre-compiled version of the stored Procedure
- Secure as schema is safeguarded and not displayed to anyone
Disadvantages:
- Too many stored procedures, memory and storage 
- Construction of stored procedure is difficulty as it requires entire schema understanding
- Hard to Debug


Stored Functions:
- SQL statements
- Stored Server side
- Does something specific
- Functions take only one type of input and have a return statement for returns
-
