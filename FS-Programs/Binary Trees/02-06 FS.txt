Imagine you're an archivist in the ancient Kingdom of Numeria, tasked with 
recording the royal lineage on a sacred scroll. Every monarch is identified 
by a unique number, and the family tree unfolds in a very specific way. 
Your mission is to transcribe this dynasty using a method that adheres 
to the following customs:

Royal Inscription:  
- Each monarch’s unique number is written as their signature on the scroll.

Enclosing Descendants:  
- If a monarch has offspring, their descendants must be recorded inside parentheses 
  immediately following the monarch’s number.
    - The first-born (or primary heir) is enclosed in its own set of parentheses.
    - If there is a second-born, their number is similarly enclosed, following 
      the first-born’s parentheses.

Omitting Redundant Markings:  
- Empty pairs of parentheses are generally left off the scroll to keep the record neat.
- However, if a monarch has a second-born but first-born is no more, you must include 
  an empty pair of parentheses to clearly mark the absence of a primary heir—ensuring 
  the lineage is accurately mapped.

Your task is to create such an inscription that perfectly reflects the 
hierarchical structure of the royal lineage.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
1 2 3 4

Sample Output-1:
----------------
1(2(4))(3)

Explanation:
        1
       / \
      2   3
     /    
    4

- Monarch 1 is the founding ruler. He has two heirs: Monarch 2 (first-born) and 
  Monarch 3 (second-born).
- Monarch 2 has a single descendant, Monarch 4, recorded as his first-born.
- Since empty markings for non-existent descendants are omitted (because they 
  don't add any information), the inscription is kept concise.
- Thus, the final transcription on the sacred scroll is: "1(2(4))(3)"

Sample Input-2:
---------------
1 2 3 -1 4

Sample Output-2:
----------------
1(2()(4))(3)

Explanation:
        1
       / \
      2   3
       \
        4

- Monarch 1 is the founding ruler with two heirs: Monarch 2 and Monarch 3.
- In this dynasty, Monarch 2 first-born is no more alive but does have a younger 
  descendant, Monarch 4.
- To ensure the record accurately reflects the gap in succession for Monarch 2, 
  an empty pair of parentheses is added before representing Monarch 4. 
  This explicitly marks the absence of a first-born heir.
- Therefore, the recorded inscription becomes: "1(2()(4))(3)"

Sample Input-3:
---------------
1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 7

Sample Output-3:
---------------
1(2(4()(7)))(3(5)(6))



Construct BT String 

Imagine you’re decoding a secret message that outlines the hierarchical structure 
of a covert spy network. The message is a string composed of numbers and parentheses. 
Here’s how the code works:

- The string always starts with an agent’s identification number, this is the 
  leader of the network.
- After the leader’s ID, there can be zero, one, or two segments enclosed in 
  parentheses. Each segment represents the complete structure of one subordinate 
  network.
- If two subordinate networks are present, the one enclosed in the first (leftmost) 
  pair of parentheses represents the left branch, and the second (rightmost) 
  represents the right branch.

Your mission is to reconstruct the entire spy network hierarchy based on this 
coded message.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
4(2(3)(1))(6(5))

Sample Output-1: 
----------------
[4, 2, 6, 3, 1, 5]

Spy network:
        4
       / \
      2   6
     / \  /
    3   1 5

Explanation:
Agent 4 is the leader.
Agent 2 (with its own subordinates 3 and 1) is the left branch.
Agent 6 (with subordinate 5) is the right branch.

Sample Input-2:
---------------
4(2(3)(-1))(6(5)(7))

Sample Output-2:
-----------------
[4, 2, 6, 3, -1, 5, 7]

Spy network:
         4
       /   \
      2     6
     / \   / \
    3   1 5   7

Explanation:
Agent 4 leads the network.
Agent 2 with subordinates 3 and 1 forms the left branch.
Agent 6 with subordinates 5 and 7 forms the right branch.


BT DIAMETER

Imagine you are designing a network of secret corridors in an ancient castle. Each chamber in the castle leads to at most two other chambers through hidden passageways, forming a branching layout. The castle’s "longest secret route" is defined as the maximum number of corridors you must traverse to get from one chamber to another (without repeating the corridor). This route may or may not pass through the main entry hall.
Your task is to compute the length of longest secret route between two chambers which is represented by the number of corridors between them.

Example 1
input=
1 2 3 4 5 
output=
3

Structure:
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \
   4   5

Explanation:
The longest secret route from chamber 4 to chamber 3 (alternatively, from chamber 5 to chamber 3) along the route:
4 → 2 → 1 → 3
This path has 3 corridors (4–2, 2–1, 1–3), so the length is 3.

Example 2:
input=
1 -1 2 3 4
output=
2

Structure:
   1
    \
     2
    / \
   3   4

Explanation:
The longest secret route from chamber 3 to chamber 4 (alternatively, from chamber 1 to chamber 4) along the route:
3 → 2 → 4
This path has 2 corridors (3–2, 2–4), so the length is 2.


Constraints:
The castle can have between 1 and 10,000 chambers. 
Each chamber is assigned a value (which could be used for other purposes in the design) ranging from -100 to 100.
